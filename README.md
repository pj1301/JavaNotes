# JavaNotes

This is a simple notes app developed using JavaFX to practice the manipulation of elements and to test out writing data to a file through serialisation.

## Functionality
To create a new note, simply enter the input into the input panel at the bottom of the app window. Then click the add button with the green tick. 

To edit a note, click on the note to be edited, then type in a new text entry in the field, then click the button with the blue pencil. This will update that field. 

To delete a field, click on the field to be deleted and then click on the button with the red trash can.
